Certainly! Let's create an introductory lesson plan on Python functions that builds upon the students' knowledge of while loops and dictionaries. We'll emphasize abstraction and reinforce their existing understanding. Here's a structured lesson plan:

---

# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Python Functions and Abstraction

## Objective:
- Understand the concept of functions in Python.
- Learn how to create user-defined functions.
- Explore abstraction and its importance.

## Prerequisites:
- Familiarity with while loops and dictionaries.

## Duration:
Approximately 60 minutes.

---

## 1. Recap: Where We've Come So Far
- Begin by acknowledging the progress the students have made.
- Mention that they are now at a point where they know most of the fundamental concepts needed for programming.
- Highlight the importance of building on this foundation.

---

## 2. Introduction to Functions
### 2.1 What Are Functions?
- Explain that functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
- Functions allow us to organize code, avoid repetition, and improve readability.

### 2.2 Creating User-Defined Functions
- Discuss the syntax for defining functions:
    ```python
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Function body
        # ...
        return result
    ```

### 2.3 Function Components
- Parameters (input) and return value (output).
- The `return` statement.

## 3. Abstraction and Functions
### 3.1 Abstraction
- Define abstraction as hiding complex details and focusing on essential features.
- Explain how functions promote abstraction by encapsulating logic.

### 3.2 Benefits of Abstraction
- Code modularity.
- Easier maintenance.
- Improved collaboration.

---

## 4. Hands-On Practice
### 4.1 Writing Simple Functions
- Have students create basic functions that perform tasks like calculating the area of a rectangle or converting temperatures.

### 4.2 Nested Dictionaries and While Loops
- Extend their knowledge by combining functions with nested dictionaries and while loops.
- Example:
    ```python
    # Managing coffee and tea consumption
    coffee_list = {"Peter": 0, "Eva": 0, "Franka": 0}
    while True:
        name = input("Name: ")
        if name == "":
            break
        getr√§nk = input("Beverage (coffee/tea): ")
        if getr√§nk.lower() == "coffee":
            coffee_list[name] += 1
            print(coffee_list[name])
        elif getr√§nk.lower() == "tea":
            tea_list[name] += 1
            print(tea_list[name])
    ```

### 4.3 Supermarket Inventory
- Introduce a more complex example using dictionaries:
    ```python
    supermarket = {
        "milk": {"quantity": 20, "price": 1.19},
        "biscuits": {"quantity": 32, "price": 1.45},
        # Add more items...
    }
    total_value = 0
    for article, numbers in supermarket.items():
        quantity = numbers["quantity"]
        price = numbers["price"]
        product_price = quantity * price
        print(f"{article:15s} {product_price:08.2f}")
        total_value += product_price
    print("=" * 24)
    print(f"Total sum: {total_value:08.2f}")
    ```

---

## 5. Conclusion
- Recap the key points: functions, abstraction, and practical examples.
- Encourage students to explore more complex functions and apply abstraction in their own projects.
